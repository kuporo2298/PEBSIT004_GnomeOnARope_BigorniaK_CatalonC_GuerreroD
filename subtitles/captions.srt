18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,700

19
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,233
let me show you the game first

20
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,100

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,400
ito

22
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,133
ito ang magpapakita sa unang title screen

23
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,33

25
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,0
so let's select

26
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:42,933
easy mode

27
00:00:44,33 --> 00:00:45,300
sa easy mode ah

28
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:46,666
mabagal lang yung rope

29
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,0
at hindi ganun ka

30
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,333
ah laki

31
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,266
yung mga

32
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,100
obstacles

33
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,900
na meron

34
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:53,733
basta steady

35
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,400
ka lang at nasa gitna is pwede mo na siyang tapusin

36
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,300
agad agad

37
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,233
pagkapunta mo sa ilalim

38
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,200
makukuha mo yung

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,100
ay namatay

40
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,733
ayun namamatay siya pag natatouch niya yung mga spike

41
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,433
pero yung mga obstacles hindi

42
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:14,433
so

43
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:17,266
ang objective ng game na to is pumunta ka sa ilalim ng

44
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,733
well at kunin mo yung treasure

45
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,300
at para manalo is makakapunta ka dun

46
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,866
pag nakapunta ka na sa taas na

47
00:01:23,0 --> 00:01:23,800
hawak mo yung

48
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:24,800
treasure

49
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,466
so yan

50
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,0
pagkahawak mo ng treasure pwede ka nang bumalik sa taas

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,300
at

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,0
manalo

53
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:38,800
ayan ito yung win

54
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
stage natin

55
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,900
pwede nating iback to main

56
00:01:42,0 --> 00:01:43,700
menu or new game sa easy mode na to

57
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,200
so pag ibaback to game main

58
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,933
ah main menu natin ayan

59
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:48,933
meron tayong

60
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,133
medium mode and hard mode

61
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,133
sa medium mode meron

62
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,233
mas maraming

63
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,0
obstacles

64
00:01:53,0 --> 00:01:54,266
and mas masakit na

65
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,100
laruan

66
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,266
then we have

67
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,133
hard mode

68
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,300
which is yung pinakamahirap na masikip

69
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,133
at maraming

70
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:03,733
obstacles

71
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,300
na kailangan mo gamitan ng tilt

72
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,633
yun lang

73
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:10,900
so after that

74
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,600
ahmm iexplain ko naman sa inyo yung architecture

75
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
na ginamit namin

76
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,433
sa larong ito

77
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,300
so

78
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,100
ang build

79
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,33
profile namin is

80
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,100
we're building on the android platform

81
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,433
so ito lang yung settings

82
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,500
na ginamit namin yung

83
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,433
default lang

84
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,833
at sa scene list

85
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,233
ginamitan

86
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,266
syempre

87
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:28,666

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,466
eto yung scene

90
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,66
eto yung dapat na tamang order ng pagkakagawa niya so

91
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,266
menu easy

92
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:36,833
hard tsaka medium

93
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:43,133
yun yung pagkakaayos niya or pwede nating imove

94
00:02:46,33 --> 00:02:48,700
ahmm i'm gonna show you some of the coding

95
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,700

96
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,266

part na yun

140
00:03:56,33 --> 00:03:56,833
then after nun

141
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,333
is we have the camera follow

142
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,233

143
00:03:59,233 --> 00:03:59,866

00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,33
gnome pag pababa

149
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,633
siya para hindi lang dun sa

150
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,66
kung saan natin

151
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
nailagay yung camera

152
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,66
ay dun na siya pupunta

153
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:14,900
kaya tignan

154
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,700

155
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,100
ang camera natin is nakapoint

156
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,100
sa taas lang ito

157
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,0
nakapoint lang siya sa taas ng kwan

158
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
pero ang ginawa natin is

159
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
lagyan natin na siya

160
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:27,933

ating gnome

164
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,100
then we have the game manager

165
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
pag wala tong game manager di natin maaayos ito

166
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,633

177
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,33
main mechanics

178
00:04:51,66 --> 00:04:52,266

syempre magrereset siya after delay

186
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,466
then pag

then we have the menu

243
00:06:25,33 --> 00:06:25,833
script

244
00:06:26,33 --> 00:06:27,266

250
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,300
itong remove

251
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,100
after delay

252
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,900
naman is

253
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,933
ginagamit para mawala yung katawan

254
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,100
pagkatapos ng

255
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,33

00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,66
syempre para

259
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,500
pag pinindot natin yung reset

260
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,733

261
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,0
pati yung mga bagay

262
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,0
bagay na nasa loob

263
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,433
then ito yung main team natin

264
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,333
which is yung

265
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:56,866
ahmm rope

266
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,400
script dito

267
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,533
ang pinaka

268
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,933
main function ng

269
00:07:01,66 --> 00:07:01,866
script natin is

270
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,233
ahmm yung isang object na which is yung rope

00:07:06,66 --> 00:07:08,600
prefab inuulit ulit niya lang yun na gawin

273
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,300
so halimbawa one inch na rope

274
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,333

ah yung object na yun

277
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,66
iduduplicate

278
00:07:15,66 --> 00:07:16,700
niyo lang ng iduduplicate para humaba

279
00:07:17,0 --> 00:07:17,900
pag ibababalik

402
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:33,933
ayan kung ano yung

403
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,966
video na yun kung fit yung

404
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,333
ang

405
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,766
phone mo diyan yan yung makikita

406
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:39,933
niya tsaka yun

407
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,566
then sa rope

408
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:42,766
dito na

409
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,466
dito naman dito nakalagay nakapwesto yung rope natin

410
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:46,866
sa input

411
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,333
manager

412
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,433
yan yung nagkukuha ng input

413
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,833
natin sa event system

414
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,0
yan naman

415
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,266
para makuha niya yung

416
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,966
tamang pagkuha ng button

417
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:56,933
sa game manager

418
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:57,933
ito yung mga

419
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,200
ilalagay natin para sa game manager

420
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,0
natin para

421
00:11:01,0 --> 00:11:02,133
maglaro ng maayos

422
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,633
then sa start point

423
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,666
dito magsisimula yung

424
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,433
load natin

425
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,0
treasure

426
00:11:06,0 --> 00:11:06,800
present

427
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,166
pag present na yung treasure sa kamay

428
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,66
nung gnome

429
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,666
ayan papalitan niya na yung

430
00:11:13,0 --> 00:11:13,800
kamay niya

431
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:14,666
then sa background

432
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,766
ayan tong black

433
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,66
medyo gray para hindi siya

434
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,866
medyo black para hindi siya

435
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,166
magmukhang gray

436
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:20,833
then sa level

437
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,633
ito naman yung

438
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,966
laman niya lahat day

439
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,66
itong mga to

440
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,533
kaya makikita

441
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,733
natin sa background brown

442
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,133
and ito naman

443
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,400
background natin sa level

444
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,466
pagkatapos ng level

445
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,433
syempre

446
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,533
yung menu

447
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,0
natin para mailagay natin yung script sa ibang bagay

448
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,666
sa mga screens ng phone na gagamitin

449
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:18,566
for example

450
00:14:19,33 --> 00:14:20,533
tong laro kasi is nakadesign

451
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,266
for smaller

452
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,666
screens kaya pag nilakihan

453
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,233
is na

454
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,266
nagugulo yung ibang

455
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,233
dimension

456
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,966
tas pag sobrang liit naman ng phone

457
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,66
is

458
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,366
na nagugulo ganun din nagugulo yung

459
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:34,866
yung mga dimension niya

460
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,433
so ang improvement na pwede kong

461
00:14:37,66 --> 00:14:38,66
isuggest sa larong

462
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,100
to is gawin siyang

463
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:39,833
3D

464
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,866
pero syempre ibang usapan

465
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:41,633
na ang three d

466
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,733
kaya mahirap gawin yun

467
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,666
pero that's a good improvement

486
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:39,733
eto yung

487
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,666
step by step

488
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,633
guide kung paano irun

489
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:43,766
and export

490
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,700
ah import

491
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:45,566
yung ating file

492
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,300
so first and foremost

493
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,100
download muna natin yung zip at

494
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,233
extract yung laman

495
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,66
pagkatapos natin

496
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,533
extract

497
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,933
open natin tong unity hub

498
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,900
pagka open natin sa unity hub

499
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,166
punta lang tayo dito sa add

500
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,666
then let's go to add

501
00:11:58,933 --> 00:11:59,900
project from disk

502
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,933
then punta tayo kung saan nag

503
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,233
extract yung laro natin

504
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,33
then pindutin mo lang yung folder

505
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,266
then pagka open mo

506
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,833
ayan magwawarning siya

507
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:11,100
tong warning na to lalabas lang to pag

508
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,500
yung

509
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,766
ginamit nating

510
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,133
tawag dito

511
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,233
yung ginamit nating

512
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,166
editor version is mas mataas

513
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,133
so in this case

514
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,333
galing sa

515
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,133
pc ko yung file na to so

516
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,433
two point five

517
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,966
f yung version niya ang meron sa laptop na to is

518
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,433
two point four f

519
00:12:30,0 --> 00:12:30,800
ayan

520
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,833
so fast forward

521
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,266
ah nagpakita na to

522
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,400
so

523
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,266
kahit naman hindi mo makita to

524
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:38,600
ang kailangan

525
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,500
nating gawin is

526
00:12:40,66 --> 00:12:41,333
pindutin natin tong card

527
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,333
platform

528
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,333
at palitan natin ng android para mas mapabilis yung

529
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,866
ahmm pagloading natin

530
00:12:48,66 --> 00:12:48,866
so

531
00:12:49,33 --> 00:12:51,800
PS tong laro na to is made siya for android

532
00:12:52,0 --> 00:12:52,800
specifically

533
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,133
kasi kailangan

534
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,33
kaya kailangan

535
00:12:55,33 --> 00:12:55,833
natin mag install

536
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:56,700
ng android

537
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,500
build support

538
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,133
pag mag

539
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:58,933
install tayo ng

540
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,266
ah installer

541
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,266
so that's the 

542
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,633
pre requisite para maranto

543
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,133
is use which is yung android

544
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,933
ah build support

545
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,666
then iopen na lang natin siya

546
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,433
then change

547
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,333
version

548
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,700
yan pag nagpakita tong mga to continue lang natin

549
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,166
pag walang nagpakitang ganun

550
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,233
ang nagpapakita dapat talaga is halimbawa ito

551
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,33
pag pinindot mo siya

552
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,633
ayan ganito

553
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,533
lang siya

554
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,200
pag hindi

555
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,633
pag parehas lang kayo ng version

556
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,566
so

557
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,133
ang kailangan

558
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:29,966
pa rin nating gawin

559
00:13:30,66 --> 00:13:30,633
for example

560
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:31,833
naimport na natin ganito

561
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,466
yung normal na magpapakita

562
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,533
then

563
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,733
pindutin natin yung editor

564
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:36,766
version

565
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,866
palitan natin yung current

566
00:13:38,33 --> 00:13:38,633
platform

567
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:39,933
and palitan natin to

568
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:40,866
android

569
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:41,666
then open

570
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,33
pagkapindot mo ng android

571
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,366
open with

572
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,133
six thousand

573
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,800
point two point four f one

574
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,833
so yan pagka open na pagka

575
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:49,733
open natin

576
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,500
wait lang natin

577
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,900
magloading lahat yan

578
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,166
pag wala ng nagpapakitang

579
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,833
compiling

580
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,600
script sa

581
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,533
sa lower right

582
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,500
pwede na nating

583
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,400
open yung scenes

584
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,633
punta tayo sa menu

585
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,700
double click natin

586
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,333
then play the game

587
00:14:04,0 --> 00:14:04,766
so yun lang

588
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,566
way para ma

589
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,500
run yung game

590
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,166
and one way

591
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:07,966
syempre ibuild mo

592
00:14:08,33 --> 00:14:08,600
gawin mo siyang

593
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,700
apk para maglaro mo siya sa cellphone
